                <p>Hi, I'm Franz Pretorius, a front-end developer with a creative flair that's always a cut above the rest! I've got a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always styling my skills with the latest trends.</p>
                <p>After branching out from the University of Johannesburg, I committed to a 6-month Web Development course at CodeSpace Academy, where I merged my knowledge with hands-on experience in TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, Bootstrap, Framer-Motion and version control tools like Git and GitHub. I'm currently upskilling in UI/UX design using Figma.</p>
                <p>My portfolio is loaded with projects that showcase my skills, from a bank landing page to a kanban task management application, and even a podcast app that streams online content using the Fetch API.</p>
                <p>I'm a team player who's always ready to lend a hand and collaborate on projects. My debugging skills are on point, and I'm always adapting to new development tasks.</p>
                <p>As a dedicated problem-solver, I thrive on resolving issues and completing projects to the highest standard. If you're looking for a reliable, enthusiastic front-end developer who's always connected and ready to push the boundaries, let's link up and create something amazing together!</p>
